# first ML project
The concept of the house price prediction project involves building a machine learning model that can predict the prices of houses based on various features or attributes. The aim is to develop a model that can estimate the value of a house given its characteristics, assisting real estate agents, homebuyers, or investors in making informed decisions. Collect a dataset containing relevant information about houses, such as size, number of bedrooms, location, amenities, age, and other features that may influence the price. Train the selected model using the training set. By developing a house price prediction model, users can gain insights into the factors influencing house prices and make more informed decisions when buying or selling properties.The house price prediction project involves creating a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the prices of houses based on their attributes. By analyzing factors such as size, location, amenities, and age, the model learns the patterns and relationships that influence house prices. This predictive model aims to assist real estate professionals and prospective buyers in making informed decisions, optimizing their investments, and understanding the value of a property in the market.
